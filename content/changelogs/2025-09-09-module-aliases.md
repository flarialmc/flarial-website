# UPDATE 📝

## Improvements 🔥

### Module Aliases
- Added aliases for modules (take effect while searching in the ClickGUI)
- Should make it easier to find modules if you know them by different names
- Example: Certain people did not know that Hive Utils and Zeqa Utils contained auto requeue and hence assumed that we didn't offer it as a feature
- Now searching for auto requeue/auto rq will also show both those modules
- If you want certain aliases to be added, create a ticket and list them
