# LAUNCHER UPDATE 🚀

## Improvements 🔥

### Auto Inject
- Added a new feature called "Auto Inject" which is disabled by default
- This feature allows the launcher to automatically inject the client whenever Minecraft is launched
- Makes it easier to use Flarial Client:
  - Alongside other mods like BetterRenderDragon
  - Makes client injection more seamless

## Notes 📝

- This feature is considered experimental
- This feature might be removed in the future due to being experimental
- The launcher should automatically update to receive this update
- If the launcher doesn't allow you to auto-update consider redownloading the launcher
