# LAUNCHER UPDATE 🔧

To address the various connection issues occurring when connecting to our new Cloudflare CDN:

**The launcher now supports the ability to use a local proxy to address any potential connection issues.**

Please redownload the launcher if it cannot automatically update and report any issues or bugs in our community support channels.

Please let us know if there are any issues via our [GitHub Issue Tracker](https://github.com/flarialmc/dll/issues) or community support.
