# IMPORTANT UPDATE 🚨

We have officially shifted to Cloudflare for hosting our content!

## What's New

- This should fix any "429 (Too Many Requests)" errors coming from GitHub
- This update also removes unused code & features reducing overall file size
- This update should resolve any prior issues caused by GitHub being used as CDN

Please redownload the launcher if it cannot automatically update, and report any issues or bugs in our community support channels!

Please let us know if there are any issues via our [GitHub Issue Tracker](https://github.com/flarialmc/dll/issues) or community support.
