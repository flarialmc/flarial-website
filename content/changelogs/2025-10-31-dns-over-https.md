# MINOR LAUNCHER UPDATE 🔨

## New Feature: DNS Over HTTPS

Added DNS Over HTTPS (DoH) support.

- DoH resolves DNS records securely over HTTPS and bypasses system-configured DNS servers
- Can be used by passing `--use-dns-over-https` via the command line to the launcher

**If you are on Windows 11, consider using the operating system's DoH instead of the launcher's DoH.**

Please let us know if there are any issues via our [GitHub Issue Tracker](https://github.com/flarialmc/dll/issues) or community support.
