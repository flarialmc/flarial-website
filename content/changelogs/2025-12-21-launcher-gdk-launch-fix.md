# LAUNCHER HOTFIX 🔎

## Changes

- Reworked how the launcher handles launching Minecraft
- When launching GDK versions of the game, the PC Bootstrapper is fully bypassed
  - This simplifies how the launcher handles launch logic for GDK versions
  - This also avoids any issues with a modified PC Bootstrapper executable
