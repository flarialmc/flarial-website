# LAUNCHER UPDATE 🚀

## New Experimental Feature 🚨

### Wait For Resources

**Why add this?**

To ensure the game doesn't crash when injecting the client, the launcher waits for the game to initialize. Specifically, the launcher waits for the game to initialize its resources such as:
- Global Resource Packs
- Skin Packs

However, this "waiting" might result in client injection being delayed.

**What does it do?**

- By default, the option is enabled, telling the launcher to wait for resources
- When you disable it, the launcher will wait for the game to load the title screen instead
  - This will result in faster injection speeds but might increase the chances of crashing

**Please provide feedback if you disable this feature!**
