# LAUNCHER UPDATE 🚀

## Changes ✏️

The launch button is a bit verbose with status messages:
- **Updating...** → The launcher is checking for launcher updates
- **Preparing...** → The launcher is fetching information for Minecraft & the client from the internet
- **Launching...** → The launcher is launching the client

## Improvements 📈

- Added 2 buttons that can open folders that contain the data for the client & launcher

## Notes 📝

- The launcher should automatically update to receive this update
- If the launcher doesn't allow you to auto-update consider redownloading the launcher from our download page
