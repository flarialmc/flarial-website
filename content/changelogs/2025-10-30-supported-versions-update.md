# LAUNCHER BACKEND UPDATE 🌐

We have trimmed down which versions of Minecraft we support.

## Currently Supported Versions

- `1.21.73`
- `1.21.82`
- `1.21.94`
- `1.21.101`
- `1.21.114`

**If you are on an unsupported version, we recommend upgrading to a supported version.**

## Why was this done?

Minecraft: Bedrock Edition operates on a rolling release model - it doesn't maintain older versions like Minecraft: Java Edition.

- We want to align with this approach, which is why we trimmed down the version list
- It made no sense to support ancient versions like `1.20.X` and older hotfix updates
