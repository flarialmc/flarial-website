# MAJOR LAUNCHER UPDATE ‼️

## What's New

- Simplified and rewritten launcher frontend/interface
- Reworked version switcher - much more robust and reliable
- Settings and error messages are now much more descriptive

## About the New Design

The current design focuses on **function over aesthetics**. The "legacy" launcher code made it hard to add new features, mainly due to old code that wasn't designed to be expanded upon.

This "new" launcher allows for the addition of new features quite easily because it isn't held back by old code.

**Note:** In the future, the UI might be replaced with a rewrite that restores the original launcher look.
