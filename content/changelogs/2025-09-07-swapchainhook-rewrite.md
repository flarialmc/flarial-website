# MASSIVE DLL UPDATE ⚠️

## Major Changes

### SwapChain Rewrite
- The entire swapchainhook was rewritten (The rendering system, so to say)
- You may face crashes. We need everyone seeing this to test immediately to ensure stability

## Bug Fixes 🐛

- Fixed 3 different crashes that are unrelated to the SwapChain

## Disclaimer ⚠️

- We're aware about crashes and freezes when resizing the window while on DX12
- We're aware about player heads not working as expected in Tab List while on DX12
- (if you have Better Frames disabled, you're on DX12)
