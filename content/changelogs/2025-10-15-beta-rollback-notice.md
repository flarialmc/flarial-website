# IMPORTANT UPDATE ⚠️

About 4 hours ago, a new update was pushed onto our Beta branch of the client. Instead of an updated version of the client, we mistakenly pushed out an older build.

This resulted in the game crashing for many users.

## This update has been reverted/removed!

Click on "Launch" in the launcher if you are using the Beta to revert the update.

Please let us know if there are any issues via our [GitHub Issue Tracker](https://github.com/flarialmc/dll/issues) or community support.
