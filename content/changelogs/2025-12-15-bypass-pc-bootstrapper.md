# MINOR LAUNCHER UPDATE 🗒️

## New Experimental Option: Bypass PC Bootstrapper

- Allows the launcher to directly launch the game without invoking the bootstrapper first
- The launcher will not wait for the game to initialize when this option is enabled
  - The launcher will only wait for the game's window to be shown

**Bypassing the PC Bootstrapper greatly simplifies how the launcher handles its launch logic.**
