# CLIENT & LAUNCHER STATUS UPDATE 🤔

## Launcher Changes 🗒️

- Version Switcher has been restored but might be unstable
- The launcher will warn the user about the version switcher being unstable

## Client Status Update 🔎

### When will the client get an update? It has been a long time!

**Short version:** We're not sure when the client will be updated and can't provide an exact timeframe or date.

**Detailed explanation:** The developers are currently dealing with real-life issues, which is why development has stalled. Keep in mind, the client developers are high schoolers and cannot dedicate full time to the client.

### The client & launcher keeps saying my game version is unsupported, why?

The client needs to be independently updated to support a game version, and this takes time. Most people expect a day-one update as soon as a new game version is released, which isn't possible.

Please let us know if there are any issues via our [GitHub Issue Tracker](https://github.com/flarialmc/dll/issues) or community support.
