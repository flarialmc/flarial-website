# LAUNCHER UPDATE ⚠️

## Why doesn't Flarial support the latest version of Minecraft (1.21.120)?

Recently Mojang updated the game to shift from UWP to something called the GDK (Game Development Kit). Many clients including Flarial do not yet support versions of Minecraft that use the GDK.

**We don't know when we will support these GDK builds, so stay tuned for updates.**

## GDK Support Update

- The launcher partially supports GDK-based versions of Minecraft when using `Custom` DLL only
- You can now downgrade from a GDK version of the game, but be aware **the launcher will not backup any data**

Please let us know if there are any issues via our [GitHub Issue Tracker](https://github.com/flarialmc/dll/issues) or community support.
