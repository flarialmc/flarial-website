# IMPORTANT UPDATE ⚠️

Today, many users were getting "429 (Too Many Requests)" errors when trying to use the launcher.

## Why was this happening?

- 429 (Too Many Requests) indicates you are being rate limited or denied access to a given URL
- We use direct GitHub links to serve updates & content, which appears to have been overwhelmed

### A new update has been pushed for the launcher which will fix this issue and hopefully prevent it from happening in the future.

**Note:** If you are stuck in an update loop, please wait for a couple of minutes or redownload the launcher.

Please let us know if there are any issues via our [GitHub Issue Tracker](https://github.com/flarialmc/dll/issues) or community support.
