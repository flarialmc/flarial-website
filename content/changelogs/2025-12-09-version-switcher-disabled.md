# IMPORTANT LAUNCHER UPDATE 📢

## Version Switcher Disabled ❗

The launcher's version switcher has been disabled for now due to various reliability issues:

- Attempting to downgrade from a GDK version to a UWP version simply fails
  - This still occurs when attempting to directly install the game's app package
- The legacy version switcher doesn't work correctly due to the changes brought in by the GDK

**For switching versions, please use the Bedrock Launcher, Jiayi Launcher, or any tool that allows UWP versions to be installed.**

## Changes 🔎

- The general page within the launcher's settings has been slightly revamped
- The launcher will attempt to verify if it can connect to `cdn.flarial.xyz`
  - This website serves updates for both the client and launcher
- Auto-updates for the launcher are no longer forced - you can now postpone the update

Please let us know if there are any issues via our [GitHub Issue Tracker](https://github.com/flarialmc/dll/issues) or community support.
