# BETA UPDATE 📝

## Changes

- Fixed `Nametag` in `Freelook`
- `Java Inventory Hotkeys` has been disabled on all GDK versions (1.21.120 and higher) due to vanilla implementation
- `Motion Blur` has been disabled on all GDK versions due to issues with `Better Frames` (DX11 fallback)

Please let us know if there are any issues via our [GitHub Issue Tracker](https://github.com/flarialmc/dll/issues) or community support.
